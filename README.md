# Expenso
Expenso is a webapp designed to help you manage your lifestyle and expenditures all in one! <br />

Upon making an account (work in progress), you'll be able to input your personal health and fitness levels, your regular spending and consumption habits, and your personal goals (also work in progress). Expenso will calculate your ExpELO, which is a relative rating level of your data in comparison to the population (not even in progress yet). From there, it'll guide you through different ways to increase your ExpELO through a stronger diet, thoughtful consumption of basic utilities, and so on. Compete with people all around the world to be the very best at helping the world go green and stay clean (will probably never be in progress)! <br />
